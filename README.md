# Writing Django 2

Having investigated [Django 1 with Python 2](http://github.com/mramshaw/Writing_Django) it seemed
time to investigate Django __2__ with Python __3__, mainly because Python 2 support ends in 2020.

[As my initial exercise was pretty straightforward, rather than try to update that repo, I will
 simply recreate the whole exercise with Django 2 and Python 3.]

# LTS

Note that we will use the __LTS__ version of Django 2, which at the time of writing (November 2019)
is __2.2.7__.

This release requires Python [3.5 or more recent](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/faq/install/#faq-python-version-support).

# Python 3

Verify the version of Python as follows:

```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.2
$
```

[Replace with <kbd>python --version</kbd> if you only have Python 3 installed.]

# Versions

* Django __2.2.7__
* gunicorn __20.0.2__
